# Alpha-Electronics

Alpha Electronics is an E-commerce website for selling and buying of all the electronic products.
In this project, I have added all type of electronic products through API fetch method.
Apart from this, I have connected my contact page with my MySQL database.

My aim to develop this project is to enhance my skills on various technologies like PHP, Firebase, JavaScript, HTML, CSS etc.

I am still working on my project as log-in/sign-up/add-to-cart button are currently in development phase and it will be published soon.

Technologies Used:-

1) HTML/CSS :- For designing purposes.
2) Java Script :- For functionality and to use APIs to fetch products.
3) PHP :- To connect my contact form with the database.
4) MySQL :- To store all the data in the database server.
